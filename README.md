                <ol> 
                    <li>The Abacus (c. 3000 BC):
                    The abacus, one of the earliest known computing devices, was used for arithmetic calculations. It laid the foundation for future computational tools.</li>
                    
                    <li>Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1837):
                    Often called the "father of the computer," Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer. Although it was never completed, the design concepts are considered the blueprint for modern computers.</li>
                    
                    <li>Alan Turing and the Turing Machine (1936):
                    Alan Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Machine, a theoretical device that could simulate any computer algorithm. His work laid the groundwork for computer science and artificial intelligence.</li>
                    
                    <li>The ENIAC (1945):
                    The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. It was used primarily for military calculations during World War II and marked the beginning of the computer age.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Advent of the Microprocessor (1971):
                    The introduction of the microprocessor by Intel revolutionized computing by enabling the development of smaller, more affordable computers. This breakthrough led to the personal computing revolution.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Rise of the Internet (1980s-1990s):
                    The development of the internet connected computers globally, enabling the sharing of information and giving rise to the World Wide Web. This milestone transformed communication, commerce, and entertainment.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Smartphone Era (2007):
                    The launch of the iPhone in 2007 marked the beginning of the smartphone era, combining computing power, internet access, and mobile communication in a single device. Smartphones have since become ubiquitous, impacting nearly every aspect of daily life.</li>

                        <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, 
                        infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, 
                        IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. 
                        The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.</p>

                <h1>Hardware Components</h1>
                <p1>Hardware components that you should be familiar with to understand IT. Each of these is essential for an infrastructure based on technology to work. </p1>
                <ul>
                    <li><B>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</B> A CPU is the device inside a computer that reads electrical signals to receive and transmit instructions. 
                    It receives its instructions from software and delivers instructions to other hardware components. Hardware: The physical components of a computer (CPU, memory, storage).</li>
                    <li><B>Hard drive:</B> The hard drive provides data storage, holds your operating system, and stores applications. 
                        Binary-encoded information can be read or written by electrical and magnetic fields.</li>
                    <li><B>Random access memory:</B> This component is used for temporary storage. Because the information loaded on it can be accessed and changed much more quickly than information on a hard drive, 
                        activities are completed using RAM and later stored on the hard drive. </li>
                    <li><B>Motherboard:</B> A large circuit board that holds other components, including the CPU and hard drive. It transmits power to each of those components and assists with communication. </li>
